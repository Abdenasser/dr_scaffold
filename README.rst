**Scaffold django rest apis like a champion** âš¡

Overview
--------

Coming from a ruby on rails ecosystem I've been always wondering if
there's a CLI we can use with Django to generate a bare minimum setup
for our apps like the one we have in rails, so I started looking for a
django CLI that does the same but couldn't find anything that suits my
needs.. so I decided to create one.

**Checkout the video demo** : `Getting Started
with dr_scaffold <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhMJf4pL90o>`_

This Library should help you generate full **Restful API Resources**
using one command:

.. code:: console

    $ python manage.py dr_scaffold blog Post title:charfield body:textfield author:foreignkey:Author

    ðŸŽ‰ Your RESTful Post api resource is ready ðŸŽ‰

-  **models.py** containing Models with all fields generated using CLI âš¡
-  **admin.py** containing with the previous Models already registered âš¡
-  **views.py** including Django Rest Framework ViewSets with all
   actions necessary for CRUD operations using Mixins, documented using
   swagger.âš¡
-  **urls.py** containing all needed URLs necessary for CRUD endpoints.âš¡
-  **serializers.py** contains Model Serializers for a bare minimum DRF
   setup to get started âš¡
-  **and more ...**   

Totorial
--------

Install dr_scaffold package with the following command :

.. code:: console

    $ pip install dr-scaffold

Add dr_scaffold to your project INSTALLED_APPS:

.. code:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...,
        'dr_scaffold'
    ]

Let's now create our Api, run the commands below to generate our Author
and Post scaffolds:

.. code:: console

    $ python manage.py dr_scaffold blog Author name:charfield

    ðŸŽ‰ Your RESTful Author api resource is ready ðŸŽ‰

.. code:: console

    $ python manage.py dr_scaffold blog Post body:textfield author:foreignkey:Author

    ðŸŽ‰ Your RESTful Post api resource is ready ðŸŽ‰

Now that our app has everything that we need let's add it to our
INSTALLED\_APPS and urls, open your ``settings.py`` file and add the app
name like the following:

.. code:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...,
        'blog'
    ]

Next, lets migrate our database through the following commands:

.. code:: console

    $ python manage.py makemigrations

.. code:: console

    $ python manage.py migrate

Next, open the urls.py file and add the path to our app urls:

.. code:: python

    urlpatterns = [
        ...,
        path("blog/", include("blog.urls")),
    ]

Finally start your server with ``python manage.py runserver`` and head
over to ``http://127.0.0.1:8000/blog/posts/`` **don't forget to checkout
your admin panel as well ``http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin``**

Framework. if not, please refer to this guide first** : `Getting Started
